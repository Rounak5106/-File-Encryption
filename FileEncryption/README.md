# File Encryption/Decryption Tool

## Overview
Developed during my internship at **Addauto Technology Pvt. Ltd.**, this Python-based tool encrypts and decrypts files to secure sensitive information. It uses **Fernet** symmetric encryption (AES-128) with password-derived keys, ensuring data confidentiality and security. The tool features a command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use.

## Objectives
- Secure files using strong encryption.
- Provide a user-friendly CLI for encryption/decryption.
- Ensure robust error handling and logging.
- Support any file type.
